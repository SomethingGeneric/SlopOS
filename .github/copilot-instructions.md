# SlopOS
Minimal operating system built in C/C++

Use resources from people who've done this before when implementing new features or chasing bugs.

## If you're refactoring in a major way,
make sure to check the run.sh and makefile for any arguements that might need to be changed

## Some good resources:
* OS development wiki - https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page

Please try testing your changes where possible, using the run script and/or Makefile, but don't be afraid to ask the user to test with a full desktop system if appropriate.
